A sample or region of interest (ROI) is not always in the field of view of a microscope lens.  An automated data acqusition routine has to identify if the sample is in the view and then, acquire images, or incrementally move the stage to the correct location.   

Image fingerprinting or autoencoding are worth examining if training on a fingerprint is faster than training on entire images.  

Number of peaks in the histogram of an image may be a good feature to train on, so we considered it qualitatively.
