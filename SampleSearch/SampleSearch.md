This is one of the steps in automating an image acquisition routine for a microscope.  
The sample is not immediately in the field of view.  An automated routine has to identify that the sample is in the view or not.  
If not, the stage is moved a small increment.  

Image fingerprinting or autoencoding need to be examined.  Then train on select features instead of training on entire images.  

Number of peaks in the histogram of an image may be a good feature to train on.
